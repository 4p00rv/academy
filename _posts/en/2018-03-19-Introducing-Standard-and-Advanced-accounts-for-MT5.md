#### Choosing an account type

Not sure which account is right for you?

The Standard account suits a wide range of traders, whether you’re new or experienced. It comes with mid-range leverage and variable spreads that give you a ton of flexibility –– no matter what your market strategy is. Clients who own an existing MT5 Financial account have been automatically migrated to a Standard account.


Meanwhile, the Advanced account gives you a higher ticket size and tighter spreads (from 0.9 pips versus the Standard account’s 1.2 pips). It also has a larger product catalogue with more currency pairs and CFDs on cash indices, futures, and cryptocurrencies.


Our Volatility Indices account is used exclusively for trading our synthetic assets of the same name that are available 24/7.


All our account types come with no minimum deposit requirements and no commission per trade. You can also register one of each account type to unlock trading opportunities that are unique to each account.


Existing clients can log in to the MT5 dashboard now to <a href="https://www.binary.com/en/user/metatrader.html">manage their new accounts</a>.
