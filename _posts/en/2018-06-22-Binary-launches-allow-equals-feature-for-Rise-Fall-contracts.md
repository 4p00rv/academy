We’re pleased to announce the release of one of the most requested features from our global client base.


Now when you <strong>trade Rise/Fall contracts on Forex and Volatility Indices</strong>, you may "allow equals" to win the payout if the exit spot is <strong>also equal</strong> to the entry spot:

<div class="cta">
    <img src="{{ '/images/22-jun-18.png' | prepend: SourceUrl }}" alt="{{ page.title }}">
</div>

## How it works

If you buy a 'Higher' contract, you will only win the payout if the exit spot is <strong>higher</strong> than the entry spot. But if you "allow equals", you will also win the payout if the exit spot is <strong>equal</strong> to the entry spot.


The same goes for a 'Lower' contract when you "allow equals". You will win the payout if the exit spot is <strong>lower</strong> than or <strong>equal</strong> to the entry spot.
