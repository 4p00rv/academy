We’re excited to announce the launch of lookback options that allow you to “look back” on the life of a contract to determine the payout you’ll receive.

## How do lookbacks work?

We offer three types of lookback contracts:


<div class="row center-text">
	<div class="col-md-4">
        <div class="fill-bg-color md-padding">
            <h3>High-Close</h3>
            <p>Win the multiplier times the high minus close</p>
        </div>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-4">
        <div class="fill-bg-color md-padding">
            <h3>Close-Low</h3>
            <p>Win the multiplier times the close minus low</p>
         </div>   
	</div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
           <div class="fill-bg-color md-padding">
            <h3>High-Low</h3>
            <p>Win the multiplier times the high minus low</p>
          </div>      
	</div>
</div>	


High, low, and close refer to specific points during the contract period:

<ul class="bullet">
    <li>High – The highest point ever reached by the market</li>
    <li>Low – The lowest point ever reached by the market</li>
    <li>Close – The contract end time</li>
</ul>



## How to calculate the payout of lookback contracts

Each trade allows you to define the multiplier for each contract, which will be multiplied with the difference between specific points during the contract period.

For example, if the market has a close of 6,000 and a low of 5,200 over the contract period, then a ‘Close-Low’ lookback contract with a multiplier of $2 would have a payout of (6,000 – 5,200) * 2 = $1,600.
