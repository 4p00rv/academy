The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has announced that its ban on binary options will start from 2 July 2018 onwards.

This ban will last an initial three months and renewed as ESMA deems necessary.

Once the ban comes into effect, we will no longer offer binary options on financial assets to retail clients residing in the European Union (EU). All open trades will be carried to term.

## Looking forward

We are working hard to implement products such as lookback options, spot FX, and contracts for difference (CFDs) for retail investors in the EU, in line with the appropriate regulations.

We will also continue to offer binary options on Volatility Indices which remain unaffected by the ESMA ban.

Retail clients may also <a href="https://www.binary.com/en/user/settings/professional.html">upgrade to professional client status</a> in order to continue trading binary options on financial assets such as currencies and indices.

We thank all affected clients for their patience and understanding in this matter.
