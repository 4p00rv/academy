    <li><strong>Even/Odd</strong> – Predict whether the last digit of the last tick is an even or odd number within a selected duration from 5 ticks to 10 ticks</li>
    <li><strong>Over/Under</strong> – Predict whether the last digit of the last tick will be greater or less than your prediction within a selected duration from 5 ticks to 10 ticks</li>
    <li><strong>High Tick/Low Tick</strong> – Predict the highest or lowest tick from a sequence of 5 ticks</li>
</ul>

## New durations

We’ve also added new contract durations for the existing Up/Down trade type. Now you can select any duration between 5 and 10 ticks, as well as between 1 and 5 minutes.
