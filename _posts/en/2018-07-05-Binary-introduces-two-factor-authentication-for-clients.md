Your account security is very important to us. This is why we’ve introduced two-factor authentication to protect your Binary.com account with an extra layer of security.

## What is two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication is a method to verify your identity by providing two pieces of information. In addition to your password, you will also need to provide an authentication code in order to log in to your account. Your authentication code will be generated by a third-party authentication app such as <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&ref_topic=2954345">Google Authenticator</a>, <a href="https://authy.com/features/setup/">Authy</a>, or <a href="https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile">Duo Mobile</a> on your smartphone.


## How do I set up two-factor authentication on my Binary.com account?

You can easily set up two-factor authentication using your PC with the help of your smartphone:

<ol>
        <li>Go to Settings > Security & Limits > <a href="https://www.binary.com/en/user/security/two_factor_authentication.html">Two-Factor Authentication</a></li>
        <li>Scan the QR code with the authentication app on your smartphone.</li>
        <li>Enter the authentication code generated by the app.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication on your account.</li>
</ol>

After you’ve completed the steps above, you will be prompted to enter an authentication code every time you want to log in to your Binary.com account.
