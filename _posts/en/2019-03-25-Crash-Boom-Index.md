We are excited to announce the launch of a new index in our exclusive series of synthetic markets, the all new Crash/Boom Index, available in your Binary.com MT5 account. 

With Crash/Boom, you get an index with varying probabilities of a massive spike or drop, occurring at random intervals. Despite its randomness, this synthetic index is built to emulate the movement of an unpredictable real-world market.
