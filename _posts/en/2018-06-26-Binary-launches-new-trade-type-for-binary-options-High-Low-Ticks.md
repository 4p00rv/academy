We’re pleased to announce a new trade type for binary options: High/Low Ticks.


High/Low Ticks have a strict duration of five ticks and are available exclusively on Volatility Indices. To win the payout, you simply need to predict the highest or lowest tick out of five ticks:

</div>

## How it works

If you purchase a ‘High Tick’ contract, you win the payout if your tick prediction is the highest out of five ticks.

If you purchase a ‘Low Tick’ contract, you win the payout if your tick prediction is the lowest out of five ticks.
