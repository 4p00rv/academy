## About iWallet

<a href="https://iwl.hk">iWallet</a> is a comprehensive payment system that supports online micropayments at reasonable and competitive commission rates. As an iWallet user, you are given an e-wallet, plus an optional USD-denominated Visa prepaid debit card.

You can fund your e-wallet via international bank transfer or credit card, or by requesting funds from another iWallet user. You can withdraw your iWallet funds to your bank account.

Your iWallet account can hold up to nine popular currencies –– USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, SGD, HKD, CNY, IDR, and PHP –– and you may even exchange one currency for another, using iWallet’s currency exchange feature.

iWallet accepts users from 150 countries and is currently focused on further expanding in the Asian region where demand for micropayment solutions are high.
