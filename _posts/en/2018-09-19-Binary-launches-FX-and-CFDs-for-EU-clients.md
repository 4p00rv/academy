We’re delighted to announce the availability of Forex and CFDs on our MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform for EU clients.

This follows our successful application with the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) who is regulating our MT5 trading services for the EU.

To get started, simply <a href="https://www.binary.com/en/user/metatrader.html">create a Standard STP account</a> to trade on currency pairs, cash indices, metals, and cryptocurrencies. This account suits a wide range of traders, whether you’re new or experienced.

The Standard STP account is available in EUR and GBP, and offers tight and variable spreads. It does not charge commissions (except for trading on cryptocurrencies) nor does it require a minimum deposit.

<p class="font-s top-50">Investing in complex products, such as CFDs come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. Between 74-89% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.</p>

<p class="font-s">Prices of CFDs may vary and/or fluctuate due to current market prices and conditions, and changes in currency exchange rates. This may cause the value of your investment to go down as well as up, and you may lose some or all of the money you’ve invested.</p>

<p class="font-s">A commission and/or other fees may be charged for trading certain CFDs, thus lowering the size of your investment.</p>

<p class="font-s">Before making an investment decision, you should refer to the Key Information Documents on our website, especially the amount of margin required for the instruments that we offer.</p>
