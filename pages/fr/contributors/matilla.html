M.A. Samuel Matilla is a maverick who in 2008 (at the height of the global financial crisis) left a successful career in the electrical engineering field to begin a career trading the global currency & equity markets.

Samuel was mentored by a very successful private equity trader who drilled in him the importance of sound risk management and who taught him how to integrate both fundamental & technical analysis to analyse current market trends and to determine where the markets are headed.
