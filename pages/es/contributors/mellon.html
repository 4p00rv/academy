Jim Mellon had his first job in Hong Kong, where he lived in a window-less apartment whilst getting his first experience in fund management. He arrived at the right moment and quickly turned a GBP 25,000 stake from his employer into a couple of million. From that foundation, he continued onwards to become one of Great Britain's richest men. Most recently, he was listed no. 117 on the Sunday Times Rich List 2014, with an estimated fortune of GBP 850m ($1.3bn).
