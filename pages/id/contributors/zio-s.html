Zio S. first started trading Binary Options and FX in 2005, while he has been offering education via BlueSkyBinary since 2014. He is a specialist in mean reversion strategies with excellent money management skills and emotion control.

Having an engineering and mathematical background, Zio decided to take his structured way of thinking and to apply it to his passion, binary options, more methodically. Therefore, he joined a team of financial engineers and traders and started developing new technologies for binary options and FX with the purpose of educating traders around the world on how to trade in a safer, more responsible and overall better way following market fundamentals. This group grew into BlueSkyBinary, one of the largest binary options education and technology group.
